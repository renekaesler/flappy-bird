# Flappy Bird

A remake of Flappy Bird purely written in vanilla JS/HTML.
Unlike in other implementations, some modifications have been made:

- viewport resizes with screen
- usage of `requestAnimationFrame` instead of frame counting
- more accurate collision detection (circle collisssion instead of box collision)
- game speeds slowly up every time passing the pipes
- parallax background
